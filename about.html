             My name is Keonte, currently a senior majoring in Information Science at MSU. Outside of school I work in IT support though I am still trying to find my niche to specialize in the field. I am currently working on a few certifications to supplement my degree and hopefully lean me into a certain direction. I have always had an interest in technology and its been fun to learn about so many different aspects of it.
