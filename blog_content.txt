About
Hi, My name is Keonte, currently a senior majoring in Information Science at MSU. Outside of school I work in IT support though I am still trying to find my niche to specialize in the field. I am currently working on a few certifications to supplement my degree and hopefully lean me into a certain direction. I have always had an interest in technology and its been fun to learn about so many different aspects of it. A little more about me,when I am not focusing on studying I like to spend my free time:

PC Gaming
PC Building
Keyboard Building
Bike Riding

And some skills I want to learn are:
Archery
Dancing
Woodworking(I have some exprience but want to pick it back up)
Making my own Linux based home-server

I am looking forward to learning and doing more.
